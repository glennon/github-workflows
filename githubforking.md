<strong>When to Fork</strong>  

There are two common use cases for forking a GitHub repository:
* to customize it
* to contribute when you do not have write permissions

**customizing a repository**  
**contributing to to someone else's repository**

*Note:* When a project is cloned or forked in GitHub, the default settings are for your changes to be resubmitted back to the original project repo (not just your versions). However, there may be cases when you do not want to submit your changes back to the original repo. For instance, in the geospatial industry, some repositories are offered as templates for creating your own map. Your changes are not improvements to the original project, but rather personal customizations. If that is the case, GitHub has a special import function. Using http://import.github.com, a repository will be copied to your GitHub account, but your changes will not automatically be sent back to the original project.
